Overview
========

This package provides a [ROS][] driver for [PMD[vision]Â® CamBoard nano][PMD]
depth sensor.

The driver is packaged as a nodelet, therefore it may be directly merged inside
another ROS node to avoid unnecessary data copying. On the same time, it may be
started standalone or withing a nodelet manager. The depth, amplitude, and point
cloud data are retrieved from the device and processed only if there are
subscribers on the corresponding topics.

The `pmd_camboard_nano.launch` script (inspired by the [openni_launch][] stack
in ROS) starts the driver nodelet along with the image rectification nodelets.

Installation
============

PMD SDK installation
--------------------

This package requires PMD SDK to be installed in the system. It will search
for:

* header files in `/usr/local/pmd/include`
* shared library in `/usr/local/pmd/lib`
* plugins in `/usr/local/pmd/plugins`

Alternatively, you could put the `include`, `lib`, and `plugins` folders
elsewhere in your file system and set an environment variable `${PMDDIR}` to
point to their location.

You also need to copy the file `10-pmd.rules` provided with the SDK to
`/etc/udev/rules.d` to allow normal users to open the camera.

Package installation
--------------------

Clone this repository into a folder that is in your `$ROS_PACKAGE_PATH` and run
`rosmake pmd_camboard_nano`.

ROS API

pmd_camboard_nano::DriverNodelet
--------------------------------

### Published topics

* `depth/camera_info` (*sensor_msgs/CameraInfo*)  
  camera calibration and metadata (see Camera calibration section)

* `depth/image` (*sensor_msgs/Image*)  
  raw distances from the device, contains `float` depths in mm

* `amplitude/camera_info` (*sensor_msgs/CameraInfo*)  
  camera calibration and metadata (see Camera calibration section)

* `amplitude/image` (*sensor_msgs/Image*)  
  signal strengths of active illumination

* `points` (*sensor_msgs/PointCloud2*)  
  3D point cloud generated by the camera driver

### Parameters

* `~device_serial` (default: "")  
  specifies which device to open, empty means any

* `~calibration_file`  
  path to the file with camera calibration data

* `~frame_id` (default: "/camera_optical_frame")  
  the tf frame of the camera

* `~open_camera_retry_period` (default: 3)  
  how often (seconds) to try to open camera during the startup

* `~update_rate` (default: 30)  
  how often (Hz) to download and publish new data from the camera

* `~points_with_amplitudes` (default: false)  
  controls whether to embed signal strength in the generated point clouds

### Dynamically reconfigurable parameters

Use the [dynamic_reconfigure][] package to update this parameters in runtime.

* `~remove_invalid_pixels` (default: true)  
  replace invalid pixels in depth and amplitude images with NaNs

* `~integration_time` (default: 333)  
  integration time of the camera in us

* `~averaging_frames` (default: 0)  
  number of frames in sliding averaging window for distance data

* `~bilateral_filter` (default: true)  
  enable/disable bilateral filtering of the depth images

Misc
====

Camera calibration
------------------

By default the PMD plugin loads the calibration data from a file (provided with
the camera), which must be located within the working directory of the
application and have a name composed of the device serial number and *".dat"*
extension. If you are using the `pmd_camboard_nano.launch` file, the working
directory of the driver nodelet will be `~/.ros`. You therefore have to have a
copy of the calibration file there.

Alternatively, you can specify the location of the calibration data file as a
parameter of the nodelet (`~calibration_file`).

If the PMD plugin failed to load the calibration data, then the camera info
messages produced by the driver nodelet will be filled with the values that
*seem* to be "default" (see [this forum topic][calibration_forum_topic]).

Compatibility
-------------

This package was tested under Ubuntu Precise x64 with ROS Fuerte and under
Ubuntu Oneiric x64 with ROS Electric.

Known issues
------------

This package was tested on multiple PCs and generally worked fine, however on
one Lenovo laptop the following problems were observed:

* RViz crashed when trying to display the messages in the `/camera/points`
  topic.
  Workaround: set display style **NOT** to Points, e.g. to BillboardSpheres.

* While adjusting the parameters with dynamic reconfigure GUI the driver nodelet
  freezed and sometimes even died.
